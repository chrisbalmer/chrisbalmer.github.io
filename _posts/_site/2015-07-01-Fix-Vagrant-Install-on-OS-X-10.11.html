<p>When you upgrade to OS X 10.11, items from <code>/usr/bin/</code> are moved to <code>/Previous System/usr/bin/</code>. I believe this is part of the new “rootless” security feature in OS X 10.11. Vagrant is one of the executables moved. To fix this, you will need to disable rootless and then reinstall Vagrant.</p>

<p>First make sure there aren’t other boot-args that you will overwrite with this process by running:</p>

<pre><code>nvram -p | grep boot-args
</code></pre>

<p>If you end up with any results, you’ll want to adjust the following commands as needed to preserve the settings.</p>

<p>To disable rootless, run (<a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rootless-kernel-level-protection.1890654/#post-21430368">source</a>):</p>

<pre><code>sudo nvram boot-args="rootless=0"
# Save work before the next line
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>Once the reboot completes, reinstall Vagrant. Now your <code>vagrant</code> command should work again. Settings, box files, etc all appear to be intact after the OS upgrade and Vagrant reinstall.</p>

<p>After you’re done, if you wish to restore rootless you can run (<a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rootless-kernel-level-protection.1890654/#post-21435567">source</a>):</p>

<pre><code>sudo nvram -d boot-args
# Save work before the next line
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively you may be able to just copy over the Vagrant binary after disabling rootless. But if other files from Vagrant end up in one of the <code>/Previous System/</code> folders, it may not work. I opted to just reinstall to be sure.</p>
